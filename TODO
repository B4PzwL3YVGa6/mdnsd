Code
-----------------
  * Cache is wrong, we should have all records of the same name under
  the same node, so our tree node is actually a rrset, the rrset has
  an attribute "unique". When we say a rrset is unique, we're saying
  "there is only one record for that name and type". The way it is
  works, but we have a node for each name/type pair, so it's a little
  dumb since 98% of records are unique, we usually want to work on
  rrsets not rr individually, so we go from O(log(n)) to O(n), cause
  we need a RB_FOREACH lots of time, fix this. 
  * Fetchmyname should use the return of strlcat to check truncation.
  * Write manual pages
  * Implement cache dump.
  * Publish commands in mdnsctl.
  * Maximum packet size should be base on current iface mtu not 9k as
  it is now (jumbo frame). We could use the smaller mtu between our
  ifaces or have it per iface. Done on the client side.
  * Too much duplicated code in control.c and mdns_api.c, hinfo and
  hostname lookup can be merged.
  * Conflict name resolution.
  * Name compression.
  * Check if the signal handling code is correct.
  * Check for possible overruns when parsing packets, specially in
  name pointers.
  * Write a dummy README. DONE
  * Put prefix in mdns symbols. DONE
  * Remove api infix in mdns_api.c, it's plain lame, gotta split the
  * Put prefix in mdns symbols. DONE
    library first. DONE.
  * Think of a better syntax for mdnsctl (lookup -t HINFO foo.local). DONE
