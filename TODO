Code
-----------------
  * [BUG] When a service is unpublished/published it comes up twice.
  * Write manual pages.
  * Implement cache dump.
  * Publish commands in mdnsctl.
  * Conflict name resolution.
  * Check for possible overruns when parsing packets, specially in
  name pointers.
  * Implement service resolv. DONE.
  * Maximum packet size should be base on current iface mtu not 9k as
  it is now (jumbo frame). We could use the smaller mtu between our
  ifaces or have it per iface. DONE.
  * Remove imsg files, as they are in libutil now. DONE
  * Name compression. DONE
  * Known Answer Suppression. DONE
  * Check if the signal handling code is correct. DONE
  * Too much duplicated code in control.c and mdns_api.c, hinfo and
  hostname lookup can be merged. DONE
  * Fetchmyname should use the return of strlcat to check truncation. DONE
  * Make browsing commands (DNS-SD). DONE.
  * Unify some code in mdnsl.c. DONE
  * Write a dummy README. DONE
  * Put prefix in mdns symbols. DONE
  * Remove api infix in mdns_api.c, it's plain lame, gotta split the
  * Put prefix in mdns symbols. DONE
    library first. DONE.
  * Think of a better syntax for mdnsctl (lookup -t HINFO foo.local). DONE
  * Implement control and API protocol. DONE
  * Implement serialization so we can start the responder. DONE
  * Implement cache expiration machine. DONE
  * Import henning's log source. DONE
  * Code getopt. DONE
  * Import kif source remove route stuff ?. DONE
  * fetch all interfaces. DONE
  * Check interface types, make sure they are multicastable. DONE
